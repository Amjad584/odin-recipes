    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>South Asian dish of chicken marinated in yogurt and spices and roasted in a tandoor, a cylindrical clay oven</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1½ cups (336g) full fat plain yogurt</li>
        <li>1-inch (22g) knob ginger, peeled grated</li>
        <li>5 cloves (35g) garlic, grated</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon (0.5g) finely ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon (15g) lemon juice/li>
        <li>2 teaspoons (8g) coriander powder</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons (13g) garam masala powder</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons (9g) cumin powder</li>
        <li>2 tablespoon (34g) Kashmiri chili powder</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons (40g) Kosher salt</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon (0.5g) finely ground black pepper</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon (0.5gg) red food coloring (optional)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons (30g) paprika</li>
        <li>½ cup (120ml) vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2 pounds (900g) chicken leg quarters, skin removed</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li> In a large bowl, whisk together all the ingredients except the chicken until evenly combined. Add the
            chicken and use your hands to thoroughly coat the chicken in the marinade. Cover and refrigerate as long as
            possible for the most flavor, up to overnight.</li>
        <li>To make on a grill or grill pan, heat over medium high until almost smoking. Once hot, grease the grill with
            oil and sear the chicken for 2-3 minutes, or until browned and charred in spots. Flip and sear the other
            side for another 2-3 minutes, or until browned and charred on the second side. If grilling, cover the grill
            with a lid and lower the heat; if cooking on a grill pan place the chicken on a sheet pan and place in 375℉
            / 191℃ oven. Continue to cook for 8-10 minutes, or until the chicken has an internal temperature of 165℉ /
            74℃. Remove and let rest 5-10 minutes before serving.</li>
