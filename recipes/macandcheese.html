    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Homemade mac and cheese is not only one of the easiest things to make, but it's also one of the most satisfying.
        Nothing feels better than having such a level of control in your own life that you make macaroni and cheese from
        scratch.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Water</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>1/2 lb Macaroni (or pasta of choice)</li>
        <li>Cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li> For the first Mac and Cheese, season your boiling water generously with salt. Add your pasta of choice and
            cook just until al dente. Drain the pasta and set it to the side. </li>
        <li>Add your butter to a medium saucepan on medium heat. Once melted, add an equal part flour and mix for about
            45 seconds. Now, slowly add your whole milk and keep whisking on medium heat until it thickens. </li>
        <li>Introduce your cheese to the saucepan and whisk until velvety smooth. Finish off by whisking in a little bit
            of creme fraiche. Finally, add back your cooked pasta and toss to coat each noodle with the sauce</li>
    </ol>
